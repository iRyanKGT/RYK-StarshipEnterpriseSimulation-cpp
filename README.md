/*	PROGRAM Starship Enterprise

    AUTHOR: Ryan Kunjbehari
    FSU MAIL NAME: EF0825229
    RECITATION SECTION NUMBER: 02
    RECITATION INSTRUCTOR NAME: Yanan Yu
    COP 3014 - Summer 2009
    PROJECT NUMBER: 3
    DUE DATE: Monday 6/22/2009
    PLATFORM: Windows OS using Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 compiler

SUMMARY

This program runs an escape simulation for the Starship Enterprise from the
planet Delta Tau.  It takes the input of current ship status from the user 
and calculates all possible attack situations for the starship.  The 
program then gives the user the option to re-run the simulation or exit by 
way of a looping structure.

INPUT

The input is entirely interactive and will require the user to enter integers 
for altitude, fuel_supply, and beam_strength.  All input is typed in at the
keyboard by the user (person running the program). 

OUTPUT

All output goes to the text (console) window.  The program prints an output 
title and echoprints the user's input in a readable fashion.  Finally, the 
calculated results are printed out. 

ASSUMPTIONS

We can assume that all input data is valid and correctly entered by the 
user.  Therefore, this program may not run correctly if bad data (characters
rather than numbers) are entered.  Only the choice of yes or no is tested
for errors.
